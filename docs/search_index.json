It is one of the more sophisticated field in physics that has affected our understanding of nano-meter length scale systems important for chemistry, materials, optics, and electronics. The existence of orbitals and energy levels in atoms can only be explained by quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics can explain the behaviors of insulators, conductors, semi-conductors, and giant magneto-resistance. It can explain the quantization of light and its particle nature in addition to its wave nature. Quantum mechanics can also explain the radiation of hot body, and its change of color with respect to temperature. It explains the presence of holes and the transport of holes and electrons in electronic devices. Quantum mechanics has played an important role in photonics, quantum electronics, and micro-electronics. But many more emerging technologies require the understanding of quantum mechanics; and hence, it is important that scientists and engineers understand quantum mechanics better. One area is nano-technologies due to the recent advent of nano-fabrication techniques. Consequently, nano-meter size systems are more common place. In electronics, as transistor devices become smaller, how the electrons move through the device is quite different from when the devices are bigger: nano-electronic transport is quite different from micro-electronic transport. The quantization of electromagnetic field is important in the area of nano-optics and quantum optics. It explains how photons interact with atomic systems or materials. It also allows the use of electromagnetic or optical field to carry quantum information. Moreover, quantum mechanics is also needed to understand the interaction of photons with materials in solar cells, as well as many topics in material science. When two objects are placed close together, they experience a force called the Casimir force that can only be explained by quantum mechanics. This is important for the understanding of micro/nano-electromechanical sensor systems (M/NEMS). Moreover, the understanding of spins is important in spintronics, another emerging technology where giant magneto-resistance, tunneling magneto-resistance, and spin transfer torque are being used. Quantum mechanics is also giving rise to the areas of quantum information, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing. It is seen that the richness of quantum physics will greatly affect the future generation technologies in many aspects. 1.2 Quantum Mechanics is Bizarre The development of quantum mechanics is a great intellectual achievement, but at the same time, it is bizarre. The reason is that quantum mechanics is quite different from classical physics. The development of quantum mechanics is likened to watching two players having a game of chess, but the watchers have not a clue as to what the rules of the game are. By observations, and conjectures, finally the rules of the game are outlined. Often, equations are conjectured like conjurors pulling tricks out of a hat to match experimental observations. It is the interpretations of these equations that can be quite bizarre. Quantum mechanics equations were postulated to explain experimental observations, but the deeper meanings of the equations often confused even the most gifted. Even though Einstein received the Nobel prize for his work on the photo-electric effect that confirmed that light energy is quantized, he himself was not totally at ease with the development of quantum mechanics as charted by the younger physicists. He was never comfortable with the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics by Born and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: “God doesn’t play dice,” was his statement assailing the probabilistic interpretation. He proposed “hidden variables” to explain the random nature of many experimental observations. He was thought of as the “old fool” by the younger physicists during his time. Schrödinger came up with the bizarre “Schrödinger cat paradox” that showed the struggle that physicists had with quantum mechanics’s interpretation. But with today’s understanding of quantum mechanics, the paradox is a thing of yesteryear. The latest twist to the interpretation in quantum mechanics is the parallel universe view that explains the multitude of outcomes of the prediction of quantum mechanics. All outcomes are possible, but with each outcome occurring in different universes that exist in parallel with respect to each other.1 The development of quantum mechanics was initially motivated by two observations which demonstrated the inadeqacy of classical physics. These are the “ultraviolet catastrophe” and the photoelectric effect. 1.3 The Ultraviolet Catastrophe The ultraviolet (UV) catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, is the prediction of classical electromagnetism that the intensity of the radiation emitted by an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium goes to infinity as wavelength decreases (see figure 1.12). Figure 1.1: The ultraviolet catastrophe is the error at short wavelengths in the Rayleigh–Jeans law for the energy emitted by an ideal black body. The error, much more pronounced for short wavelengths, is the difference between the Rayleigh–Jeans law—black—and Planck’s law—blue. A black body is an idealized object that absorbs and emits all frequencies. Classical physics can be used to derive an approximated equation describing the intensity of a black body radiation as a function of frequency for a fixed temperature. The result is known as the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which for wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), is: \\[\\begin{equation} B_{\\lambda }(T)={\\frac {2ck_{\\mathrm {B} }T}{\\lambda ^{4}}} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(B_{\\lambda }\\) is the intensity of the radiation —expressed as the power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength (spectral radiance)— \\(c\\) is the speed of light, \\(k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in kelvins. The paradox —or rather the breakdown of the Rayleigh–Jeans formula— happens at small wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). If we take the limit for \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\) in eq. (1.1), we obtain that \\(B_{\\lambda } \\rightarrow \\infty\\). In other words, as the wavelength of the emitted light gets smaller (approaching the UV range), the intensity of the radiation approaches infinity, and the black body emits an infinite amount of energy. This divergence for low wavelength (high frequencies) is called the ultraviolet catastrophe, and it is clearly unphysical. Max Planck explained the black body radiation in 1900 by assuming that the energies of the oscillations of the electrons responsible for the radiation must be proportional to integral multiples of the frequency, i.e., \\[\\begin{equation} E = n h \\nu = n h \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] Planck’s assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral function for a black body: \\[\\begin{equation} B_{\\lambda }(\\lambda ,T)={\\frac {2hc^{2}}{\\lambda ^{5}}}{\\frac {1}{e^{hc/(\\lambda k_{\\mathrm {B} }T)}-1}}. \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] If we now take the limit for \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\) of eq. (1.3), it is easy to prove that \\(B_{\\lambda }\\) goes to zero, in agreement with the experimental results, and our intuition. Planck also found that for \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\; \\text{J s}\\), the experimental data could be reproduced exactly. Nevertheless, Planck could not offer a good justification for his assumption of energy quantization. Physicists did not take this energy quantization idea seriously until Einstein invoked a similar assumption to explain the photoelectric effect. 1.4 The Photoelectric Effect In 1886 and 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that ultraviolet light can cause electrons to be ejected from a metal surface. According to the classical wave theory of light, the intensity of the light determines the amplitude of the wave, and so a greater light intensity should cause the electrons on the metal to oscillate more violently and to be ejected with a greater kinetic energy. In contrast, the experiment showed that the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons depends on the frequency of the light. The light intensity affects only the number of ejected electrons and not their kinetic energies. Einstein tackled the problem of the photoelectric effect in 1905. Instead of assuming that the electronic oscillators had energies given by Planck’s formula, eq. (1.2), Einstein assumed that the radiation itself consisted of packets of energy \\(E = h \\nu\\), which are now called photons. Einstein successfully explained the photoelectric effect using this assumption, and he calculated a value of \\(h\\) close to that obtained by Planck. Two years later, Einstein showed that not only is light quantized, but so are atomic vibrations. Classical physics predicts that the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\\(C_V\\)) of a crystal is \\(3 R\\), where \\(R\\) is the molar gas constant. This works well for high temperatures, but for low temperatures \\(C_V\\) actually falls to zero. Einstein was able to explain this result by assuming that the oscillations of atoms about their equilibrium positions are quantized according to \\(E = n h \\nu\\), Planck’s quantization condition for electronic oscillators. This demonstrated that the energy quantization concept was important even for a system of atoms in a crystal, which should be well-modeled by a system of masses and springs (i.e., by classical mechanics). 1.5 Wave-Particle Duality Einstein had shown that the momentum of a photon is \\[\\begin{equation} p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}. \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] This can be easily shown as follows. Assuming \\(E = h \\nu\\) for a photon and \\(\\lambda \\nu = c\\) for an electromagnetic wave, we obtain \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda} \\tag{1.5} \\end{equation}\\] Now we use Einstein’s relativity result, \\(E = m c^2\\), and the definition of mementum \\(p=mc\\), to find: \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}, \\tag{1.6} \\end{equation}\\] which is equivalent to eq. (1.4). Note that \\(m\\) refers to the relativistic mass, not the rest mass, since the rest mass of a photon is zero. Since light can behave both as a wave (it can be diffracted, and it has a wavelength), and as a particle (it contains packets of energy \\(h \\nu\\)), de Broglie reasoned in 1924 that matter also can exhibit this wave-particle duality. He further reasoned that matter would obey the same eq. (1.6) as light. In 1927, Davisson and Germer observed diffraction patterns by bombarding metals with electrons, confirming de Broglie’s proposition.3 Rewriting the previous equations in terms of the wave vector, \\(k=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\), and the angular frequency, \\(\\omega=2\\pi\\nu\\), we obtain the following two equations \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} p &amp;= \\hbar k \\\\ E &amp;= \\hbar \\omega, \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.7} \\end{equation}\\] which are known as de Broglie’s equations. We will use those equation to develop wave mechanics in the next chapters.
