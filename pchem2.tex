If you have taken P-Chem 1 at Florida Tech in the Fall Semester 2020, you should already be familiar with this format. Everything we did with the Live Textbook of P-Chem 1 in FS2020 will be happening this semester with P-Chem 2. Please read this book carefully, since everything that will be in your exams is explained here.
Since this book is specifically tailored for the CHM 3002 course at Florida Tech, there are no superfluous parts. In other words, everything in it might be subject to question in the quizzes and the final exam.

\begin{quote}
Definitions and exercises are usually numbered and are highlighted in the text in this format (lighter grey, indented, and following a grey vertical bar). Please study the definitions carefully since they are fundamental concepts that will be used several times in the remainder of the text, and they will be subject to quizzes and exams. Exercises are essential for cementing the concepts, and you should attempt to execute them first without looking at the solution. Even if you were able to solve an exercise on your own, always read the solution after, since it might contain additional explanations expanding the main concepts in the text.

Navigating the book should be straightforward. On each page, there is a useful sidebar on the left that gives you an overview of all chapters, and a toolbar at the top with important tools. Arrows to shift between chapters might also be present, depending on your browser. If you are old-school and prefer a pdf, you can download a printout by clicking on the toolbar's corresponding icon. If you are \emph{really} old-school and prefer a printed book, the best solution is to download the pdf and print it yourself. It is a LaTeX book, and I can promise you it will look good on paper. However, I cannot provide physical copies to each student. In the toolbar, you will find a useful search box that is capable of searching the entire book. The most adventurous will find in the toolbar a link to the raw GitHub source code. Feel free to head on \href{https://github.com/peverati/PChem2}{over there} and fork the book.

Each chapter of this book represents one week of work in the classroom and at home. The sidebar on the left will reflect your syllabus, as well as the main structure of the class on Canvas. The book is a live document, which means it will be updated throughout the semester with new material. While you are not required to check it every day, you might want to review each week's chapter before the lecture on Friday.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Quantum mechanics is an important intellectual achievement of the 20th century. It is one of the more sophisticated field in physics that has affected our understanding of nano-meter length scale systems important for chemistry, materials, optics, and electronics. The existence of orbitals and energy levels in atoms can only be explained by quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics can explain the behaviors of insulators, conductors, semi-conductors, and giant magneto-resistance. It can explain the quantization of light and its particle nature in addition to its wave nature. Quantum mechanics can also explain the radiation of hot body, and its change of color with respect to temperature. It explains the presence of holes and the transport of holes and electrons in electronic devices.
Quantum mechanics has played an important role in photonics, quantum electronics, and micro-electronics. But many more emerging technologies require the understanding of quantum mechanics; and hence, it is important that scientists and engineers understand quantum mechanics better. One area is nano-technologies due to the recent advent of nano-fabrication techniques. Consequently, nano-meter size systems are more common place. In electronics, as transistor devices become smaller, how the electrons move through the device is quite different from when the devices are bigger: nano-electronic transport is quite different from micro-electronic transport.
The quantization of electromagnetic field is important in the area of nano-optics and quantum optics. It explains how photons interact with atomic systems or materials. It also allows the use of electromagnetic or optical field to carry quantum information. Moreover, quantum mechanics is also needed to understand the interaction of photons with materials in solar cells, as well as many topics in material science.
When two objects are placed close together, they experience a force called the Casimir force that can only be explained by quantum mechanics. This is important for the understanding of micro/nano-electromechanical sensor systems (M/NEMS). Moreover, the understanding of spins is important in spintronics, another emerging technology where giant magneto-resistance, tunneling magneto-resistance, and spin transfer torque are being used.
Quantum mechanics is also giving rise to the areas of quantum information, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing. It is seen that the richness
of quantum physics will greatly affect the future generation technologies in many aspects.

\section{Quantum Mechanics is Bizarre}\label{quantum-mechanics-is-bizarre}}

The development of quantum mechanicsis a great intellectual achievement, but at the same time, it is bizarre. The reason is that quantum mechanics is quite different from classical physics. The development of quantum mechanics is likened to watching two players having a game of chess, but the watchers have not a clue as to what the rules of the game are. By observations, and conjectures, finally the rules of the game are outlined. Often, equations are conjectured like conjurors pulling tricks out of a hat to match experimental observations. It is the interpretations of these equations that can be quite bizarre.
Quantum mechanics equations were postulated to explain experimental observations, but the deeper meanings of the equations often confused even the most gifted. Even though Einstein received the Nobel prize for his work on the photo-electric effect that confirmed that light energy is quantized, he himself was not totally at ease with the development of quantum mechanicsas charted by the younger physicists. He was never comfortable with the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics by Born and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: ``God doesn't play dice,'' was his statement assailing the probabilistic interpretation. He proposed ``hidden variables'' to explain the random nature of many experimental observations. He was thought of as the ``old fool'' by the younger physicists during his time.
Schrödinger came up with the bizarre ``Schrödinger cat paradox'' that showed the struggle that physicists had with quantum mechanics's interpretation. But with today's understanding of quantum mechanics, the paradox is a thing of yesteryear.
The latest twist to the interpretation in quantum mechanics is the parallel universe view that explains the multitude of outcomes of the prediction of quantum mechanics. All outcomes are possible, but with each outcome occurring in different universes that exist in parallel with respect to each other.\footnote{This section was adapted in part from Prof.~Weng Cho CHEW's Quantum Mechanics Made Simple Lecture Notes available \href{http://wcchew.ece.illinois.edu/chew/course/qmall20121005.pdf}{here}.}

The development of quantum mechanics was initially motivated by two observations which demonstrated the inadeqacy of classical physics. These are the ``ultraviolet catastrophe'' and the photoelectric effect.

\hypertarget{the-ultraviolet-catastrophe}{%
\section{The Ultraviolet Catastrophe}\label{the-ultraviolet-catastrophe}}

A blackbody is an idealized object which absorbs and emits all frequencies. Classical physics can be used to derive an equation which describes the intensity of blackbody radiation as a function of frequency for a fixed temperature--the result is known as the Rayleigh-Jeans law. Although the Rayleigh-Jeans law works for low frequencies, it diverges as \(\nu^2\); this divergence for high frequencies is called the ultraviolet catastrophe.
Max Planck explained the blackbody radiation in 1900 by assuming that the energies of the oscillations of electrons which gave rise to the radiation must be proportional to integral multiples of the frequency, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
E = n h \nu
\label{eq:uvcat}
\end{equation}

Using statistical mechanics, Planck derived an equation similar to the Rayleigh-Jeans equation, but with the adjustable parameter \(h\). Planck found that for \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}\) J s, the experimental data could be reproduced. Nevertheless, Planck could not offer a good justification for his assumption of energy quantization. Physicicsts did not take this energy quantization idea seriously until Einstein invoked a similar assumption to explain the photoelectric effect.

\hypertarget{the-photoelectric-effect}{%
\section{The Photoelectric Effect}\label{the-photoelectric-effect}}

In 1886 and 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that ultraviolet light can cause electrons to be ejected from a metal surface. According to the classical wave theory of light, the intensity of the light determines the amplitude of the wave, and so a greater light intensity should cause the electrons on the metal to oscillate more violently and to be ejected with a greater kinetic energy. In contrast, the experiment showed that the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons depends on the frequency of the light. The light intensity affects only the number of ejected electrons and not their kinetic energies.
Einstein tackled the problem of the photoelectric effect in 1905. Instead of assuming that the electronic oscillators had energies given by Planck's formula, eq. \eqref{eq:uvcat}, Einstein assumed that the radiation itself consisted of packets of energy \(E = h \nu\), which are now called photons. Einstein successfully explained the photoelectric effect using this assumption, and he calculated a value of \(h\) close to that obtained by Planck.

Two years later, Einstein showed that not only is light quantized, but so are atomic vibrations. Classical physics predicts that the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\(C_v\)) of a crystal is \(3 R\), where \(R\) is the molar gas constant. This works well for high temperatures, but for low temperatures \(C_v\) actually falls to zero. Einstein was able to explain this result by assuming that the oscillations of atoms about their equilibrium positions are quantized according to \(E = n h \nu\), Planck's quantization condition for electronic oscillators. This demonstrated that the energy quantization concept was important even for a system of atoms in a crystal, which should be well-modeled by a system of masses and springs (i.e., by classical mechanics).\footnote{The previous 2 sections were adapted in part from Prof.~C. David Sherrill's A Brief Review of Elementary Quantum Chemistry Notes available \href{A\%20Brief\%20Review\%20of\%20Elementary\%20Quantum\%20Chemistry}{here}.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Quantum mechanics cannot be derived from classical mechanics, but classical mechanics can inspire quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is richer and more sophisticated than classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics was developed during the period when physicists had rich knowledge of classical mechanics. In order to better understand how quantum mechanics was developed in this environment, it is better to understand some fundamental concepts in classical mechanics. Classical mechanics can be considered as a special case of quantum mechanics. We will review some classical mechanics concepts here.
In classical mechanics, a particle moving in the presence of potential \(V(q)\) will experience a force given by:

\$begin\{equation\}
F (q) = -\frac{dV (q)}{dq},
\label{eq:class1}
\$end\{equation\}

where \(q\) represents the coordinate or the position of the particle. Hence, the particle can be described by the equations of motion:

\$begin\{equation\}
\frac{dp}{dt} = F(q) = -\frac{dV (q)}{dq}, \frac{dq}{dt} = p/m.
\label{eq:class2}
\$end\{equation\}

For example, when a particle is attached to a spring and moves along a frictionless surface, the force the particle experiences is \(F(q) = -kq\) where \(k\) is the spring constant. Then the equations of motion of this particle are

\$begin\{equation\}
\frac{dp}{dt} =\dot{p}=-kq, \frac{dq}{dt} =\dot{q}=p/m
\label{eq:class2}
\$end\{equation\}

Given p and q at some initial time t0, one can integrate (2.1.2) or (2.1.3) to obtain p and q for all later time. A numerical analysist can think of that (2.1.2) or (2.1.3) can be solved by the finite difference method, where time-stepping can be used to find p and q for all later time. For instance, we can write the equations of motion more compactly as
dV = F(V) (2.1.4) dt
where V = {[}p,q{]}t, and F is a general vector function of V. It can be nonlinear or linear; in the event if it is linear, then F(V) = A · V.
Using finite difference approximation, we can rewrite the above as V(t + ∆t) − V(t) = ∆tF(V(t)),
V(t + ∆t) = ∆tF(V(t)) + V(t) (2.1.5)
The above can be used for time marching to derive the future values of V from past values. The above equations of motion are essentially derived using Newton's law. However, there exist other methods of deriving these equations of motion. Notice that only two variables p
and q are sufficient to describe the state of a particle. 2.2 Lagrangian Formulation
Another way to derive the equations of motion for classical mechanics is via the use of the Lagrangian and the principle of least action. A Lagrangian is usually defined as the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy, i.e.,
L(q ̇, q) = T − V (2.2.1)
where q ̇ is the velocity. For a fixed t, q and q ̇ are independent variables, since q ̇ cannot be derived from q if it is only known at one given t. The equations of motion is derived from the principle of least action which says that q(t) that satisfies the equations of motion between two times t1 and t2 should minimize the action integral
􏰟 t2 t1
S =
L(q ̇(t), q(t))dt (2.2.2)

Classical Mechanics 9
Assuming that q(t1) and q(t2) are fixed, then the function q(t) between t1 and t2 should minimize S, the action. In other words, a first order perturbation in q from the optimal answer that minimizes S should give rise to second order error in S. Hence, taking the first variation of (2.2.2), we have
􏰟t2 􏰟t2 􏰟t2􏰊 ∂L ∂L􏰋
δS=δ L(q ̇,q)dt= δL(q ̇,q)dt= δq ̇∂q ̇ +δq∂q dt=0 (2.2.3)
t1 t1 t1
In order to take the variation into the integrand, we have to assume that δL(q ̇,q) is taken with constant time. At constant time, q ̇ and q are independent variables; hence, the partial derivatives in the next equality above follow. Using integration by parts on the first term, we have
∂L􏰇t2 δS = δq 􏰇􏰇
􏰟 t2 t 1
􏰟 t2 t 1
d 􏰊∂L􏰋 ∂L
dt ∂q ̇ −∂q=0 (2.2.5)
The above is called the Lagrange equation, from which the equation of motion of a particle can be derived. The derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocity q ̇ is the momentum
−
∂ q ̇ 􏰇 t 1
δq(t) is arbitrary between t1 and t2, we have
d 􏰊∂L􏰋 d t ∂ q ̇
∂L ∂ q
δq
The first term vanishes because δq(t1) = δq(t2) = 0 because q(t1) and q(t2) are fixed. Since
p = ∂L ∂ q ̇
The derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the coordinate q is the force. Hence F = ∂L
∂q
The above equation of motion is then
p ̇ = F
Equation (2.2.6) can be inverted to express q ̇ as a function of p and q, namely
(2.2.6)
(2.2.7)
(2.2.8)
q ̇ = f(p,q)
The above two equations can be solved in tandem to find the time evolution of p and q.
For example, the kinetic energy T of a particle is given by
T = 21mq ̇2 (2.2.10)
Then from (2.2.1), and the fact that V is independent of q ̇,
p = ∂L = ∂T = mq ̇ (2.2.11) ∂ q ̇ ∂ q ̇
dt +
δq
dt = 0 (2.2.4)

10 or
q ̇ = mp Also, from (2.2.1), (2.2.7), and (2.2.8), we have
p ̇ = −∂V ∂q
Quantum Mechanics Made Simple
(2.2.12)
(2.2.13)
The above pair, (2.2.12) and (2.2.13), form the equations of motion for this problem.
The above can be generalized to multidimensional problems. For example, for a one particle system in three dimensions, qi has three degrees of freedom, and i = 1, 2, 3. (The qi can represent x,y,z in Cartesian coordinates, but r,θ,φ in spherical coordinates.) But for N particles in three dimensions, there are 3N degrees of freedom, and i = 1,\ldots,3N. The formulation can also be applied to particles constraint in motion. For instance, for N particles in three dimensions, qi may run from i = 1, . . . , 3N − k, representing k constraints on the motion of the particles. This can happen, for example, if the particles are constraint to move
in a manifold (surface), or a line (ring) embedded in a three dimensional space. Going through similar derivation, we arrive at the equation of motion
d 􏰊∂L􏰋 ∂L
dt ∂q ̇ −∂q=0 (2.2.14)
ii
In general, qi may not have a dimension of length, and it is called the generalized coordinate (also called conjugate coordinate). Also, q ̇i may not have a dimension of velocity, and it is called the generalized velocity.
The derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocity is the generalized momentum (also called conjugate momentum), namely,
pi = ∂L (2.2.15) ∂ q ̇ i
The generalized momentum may not have a dimension of momentum. Hence, the equation of motion (2.2.14) can be written as
p ̇i = ∂L (2.2.16) ∂qi
Equation (2.2.15) can be inverted to yield an equation for q ̇i as a function of the other variables. This equation can be used in tandem (2.2.16) as time-marching equations of motion.
2.3 Hamiltonian Formulation
For a multi-dimensional system, or a many particle system in multi-dimensions, the total time derivative of L is
dL􏰝􏰊∂L ∂L􏰋
= q ̇ + q ̈ (2.3.1)
dt ∂qi∂q ̇i iii

Since ∂L/∂qi = d (∂L/∂q ̇i) from the Lagrange equation, we have dt

dt i ∂q ̇i
H = 􏰝 ∂L q ̇i − L
i ∂q ̇i
is known as the Hamiltonian of the system, and is a constant of motion, namely, dH/dt = 0. As shall be shown, the Hamiltonian represents the total energy of a system. It is a constant of motion because of the conservation of energy.
The Hamiltonian of the system, (2.3.4), can also be written, after using (2.2.15), as
H = 􏰝 q ̇ipi − L (2.3.5)
i
where pi = ∂L/∂q ̇i is the generalized momentum. The first term has a dimension of energy, and in Cartesian coordinates, for a simple particle motion, it is easily seen that it is twice the kinetic energy. Hence, the above indicates that the Hamiltonian
= (q ̇iδpi + piδq ̇i) − iiii
Using (2.2.15) and (2.2.16), we have
δH = 􏰝 (q ̇iδpi + piδq ̇i) − 􏰝 (p ̇iδqi + piδq ̇i)
ii
=􏰝(q ̇iδpi −p ̇iδqi) i
From the above, we gather that the Hamiltonian is a function of pi and qi. Taking the first variation of the Hamiltonian with respect to these variables, we have
􏰝􏰊∂H ∂H 􏰋
δH = ∂p δpi + ∂q δqi (2.3.9)
iii
q ̇

12
Comparing the above with (2.3.8), we gather that
q ̇i = ∂H ∂pi
p ̇i =−∂H ∂qi
Quantum Mechanics Made Simple
(2.3.10) (2.3.11)
These are the equations of motion known as the Hamiltonian equations.
The (2.3.4) is also known as the Legendre transformation. The original function L is a function of q ̇i, qi. Hence, δL depends on both δq ̇i and δqi. After the Legendre transformation, δH depends on the differential δpi and δqi as indicated by (2.3.8). This implies that H is a function of pi and qi. The equations of motion then can be written as in (2.3.10) and (2.3.11).
2.4 More on Hamiltonian
The Hamiltonian of a particle in classical mechanics is given by (2.3.6), and it is a function of pi and qi. For a non-relativistic particle in three dimensions, the kinetic energy
T = p·p (2.4.1) 2m
and the potential energy V is a function of q. Hence, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = p·p +V(q) (2.4.2)
2m
in three dimensions. When an electromagnetic field is present, the Hamiltonian for an electron
can be derived by letting the generalized momentum
pi = mq ̇i + eAi (2.4.3)
where e is the electron charge and Ai is component of the vector potential A. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of an electron in the presence of an electromagnetic field is
H = (p−eA)·(p−eA) +eφ(q) (2.4.4) 2m
The equation of motion of an electron in an electromagnetic field is governed by the Lorentz force law, which can be derived from the above Hamiltonian using the equations of motion provided by (2.3.10) and (2.3.11).
2.5 Poisson Bracket
Yet another way of expressing equations of motion in classical mechanics is via the use of Poisson bracket. This is interesting because Poisson bracket has a close quantum mechanics analogue. A Poisson bracket of two scalar variables u and v that are functions of q and p is defined as
\{u, v\} = ∂u ∂v − ∂v ∂u (2.5.1) ∂q ∂p ∂q ∂p

Classical Mechanics 13 In this notation, using (2.3.10) and (2.3.11),
du = ∂u dq + ∂u dp = ∂u ∂H − ∂u ∂H dt ∂qdt ∂pdt ∂q ∂p ∂p ∂q
= \{u,H\}
which is valid for any variable u that is a function of p and q. Hence, we have the equations
of motion as
q ̇ = \{q, H\}, p ̇ = \{p, H\} (2.5.3)
in the Poisson bracket notation. As we shall see later, similar equations will appear in quantum mechanics.
The algebraic properties of Poisson bracket are
\{u, v\} = −\{v, u\}
\{u + v, w\} = \{u, w\} + \{v, w\}
\{uv, w\} = \{u, w\}v + u\{v, w\}
\{u, vw\} = \{u, v\}w + v\{u, w\}
\{\{u, v\}, w\} + \{\{v, w\}, u\} + \{\{w, u\}, v\} = 0
(2.5.4) (2.5.5) (2.5.6) (2.5.7) (2.5.8)
These properties are antisymmetry, distributivity, associativity and Jacobi's identity.
If we define a commutator operation between two noncommuting operator uˆ and vˆ as
{[}uˆ, vˆ{]} = uˆvˆ − vˆuˆ, (2.5.9)
it can be shown that the above commutator have the same algebraic properties as the Pois- son bracket. An operator in quantum mechanics can be a matrix operator or a differential operator. In general, operators do not commute unless under very special circumstances.
